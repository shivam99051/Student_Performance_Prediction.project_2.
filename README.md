# Student_Performance_Prediction.project_2.
The aim of this project is to predict a student's performance. The outcome of the project will help educators and students to work on weaker topics and improve overall performance.
## Objectives

- The objective of this project is to predict students’ exam scores based on their attendance, study hours, and assignment scores using a Linear Regression model.This project will help educators and students to focus on weaker topic of students and improve overall academic performance.
## Dataset

The project uses a dataset named **student_scores_dataset.csv** which contains the following columns:
- `Attendance` - Attendance percentage of the student
- `StudyHours` - Average study hours per day
- `Assignments` - Assignment score
- `ExamScore` - Final exam score (target variable)

## Steps Involved
- **Import Required Libraries**:
 Import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn       modules for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- Read the dataset from a CSV file and display the first few records.
- Select Features and Target Variable.
- Normalize the data using StandardScaler.
- Divide the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the Linear Regression Model.
- Make Predictions and Evaluate.
- **Data Visualization**:
   Pairplot of features
   Actual vs Predicted exam scores.
- **Predict for a New Student**:
  Collect user input and predict exam score.
## Installation

- **Python 3**

## Install libraries:-
**!pip install + libraries**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning (Linear Regression, StandardScaler, metrics)
## How To Run The Project
- Download the project folder.
- Install required libraries.
- Upload the data set **'student_scores_dataset.csv'**in thye project  folder.
- Run the script in your terminal.
- After running, the program will:
  -  Display the dataset summary and evaluation metrics.
  - Show visualizations (pairplot and actual vs predicted chart).
  - Prompt you to enter details for a new student:
     - Enter Attendance (%): 85
    - Enter Study Hours per Day: 3
     - Enter Assignment Score: 75
- Output the Predicted Exam Score.
